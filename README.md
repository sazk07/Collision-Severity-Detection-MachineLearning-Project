# Machine Learning: Traffic Collision Severity Detection Project

Data Science ML Project I did to predict collision severity for an online MOOC by IBM. This project is part of the Capstone Project by the IBM course to complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certification.

Used Seattle Traffic data to train the ML model
